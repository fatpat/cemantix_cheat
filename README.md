# CÃ©mantix Cheat

Nice game, but only one per day. Once done, I had to find a way to make it fun.

So here is a cheat script to find the word. Nothing magic, just using the same database as the game and play the game.

## Usage
1- build the image using `make build`
2- search for the solution: `make search`
3- search for a closed word only: `make start`
4- fill the unknown words cache only: `make fill_cache`
and wait ...
